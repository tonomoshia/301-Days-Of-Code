### Day 0: [September 27, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Trying to understand JavaScript DOM manipulation to better understand how to implement the memory game project. Re-watched [Mike Wales video][8] on the project. Udacity updated the project page to be more helpful, outlining the chunks we need to work on, helping us structure our code and break it down better.

**Thoughts:**
Excited to get started one day early. Reviewed JavaScript concepts at [JavaScript ES6 Explorer][1], [Awesome Cheatsheets][2] and [ES6 Features: Changes and Comparisons][6]. Learned about [30 Seconds of Interviews][3] from [Sara Vasquez][4] and that is a resource that I will be checking into every day.
Re-familiarized myself with Markdown syntax on [Daring Fireball Markdown: Syntax][5].
I need to re-do the Udacity section "JavaScript and the DOM" because I still don't get it.

**Link to work:**
[My Memory Game Github Repository, very much in progress][7]
