## Log

### Day 0: [September 27, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Trying to understand JavaScript DOM manipulation to better understand how to implement the memory game project. Re-watched [Mike Wales video][8] on the project. Udacity updated the project page to be more helpful, outlining the chunks we need to work on, helping us structure our code and break it down better.

**Thoughts:**
Excited to get started one day early. Reviewed JavaScript concepts at [JavaScript ES6 Explorer][1], [Awesome Cheatsheets][2] and [ES6 Features: Changes and Comparisons][6]. Learned about [30 Seconds of Interviews][3] from [Sara Vasquez][4] and that is a resource that I will be checking into every day.
Re-familiarized myself with Markdown syntax on [Daring Fireball Markdown: Syntax][5].
I need to re-do the Udacity section "JavaScript and the DOM" because I still don't get it.

**Link to work:**
[My Memory Game Github Repository, very much in progress][7]

### Day 1: [September 28, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Some work in a [The Complete WordPress Website Business Course][9] on Udemy Course by Gregg Davis. I'm 75% done with this and I would like to finish it. I've found it pretty impossible to do JavaScript at lunch at work anymore, so I'm going back to this for lunch n' code (#LunchNCode).

**Thoughts:**
I really love Gregg Davis' teaching style. He is certainly very thorough. There are some lessons he added to sections I already finished, so I completed those. He is rightly telling people to switch from [MAMP][10] to [Local By Flywheel][11]. Local is easier and it's fine for most purposes.
DId not do anything coding related after work.

**Link to work:**
No link.

### Day 2: [September 29, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Re-doing JavaScript and the DOM section of [Udacity Front End Nanodegree][12]. Hoping to understand it better this time. Changes I made to my [game][7] just broke it so I rolled them back.
Read article: [How to Understand and Modify the DOM in JavaScript][13] by [Tania Rascia][15].
Also created a staging site for my WordPress site, just a subdomain of my site. I want to try a few things without breaking things.
Learned about the [Google Analytics Certificate][14] from Google and I want to get that. Adding to my goals list.

**Thoughts:**
Finished Q&A section of Mike Wales' [video][8]. Not really that helpful.

**Link to work:**
No changes to my [game][7] as I rolled them back.
