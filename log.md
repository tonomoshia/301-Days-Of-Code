## Log

### Day 100: [September 27, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Trying to understand JavaScript DOM manipulation to better understand how to implement the memory game project. Re-watched [Mike Wales video][8] on the project. Udacity updated the project page to be more helpful, outlining the chunks we need to work on, helping us structure our code and break it down better.

**Thoughts:**
Excited to get started one day early. (This is day 100 of my #100DaysOfCode.) Reviewed JavaScript concepts at [JavaScript ES6 Explorer][1], [Awesome Cheatsheets][2] and [ES6 Features: Changes and Comparisons][6]. Learned about [30 Seconds of Interviews][3] from [Sara Vasquez][4] and that is a resource that I will be checking into every day.
Re-familiarized myself with Markdown syntax on [Daring Fireball Markdown: Syntax][5].
I need to re-do the Udacity section "JavaScript and the DOM" because I still don't get it.

**Link to work:**
[My Memory Game Github Repository, very much in progress][7]

### Day 101: [September 28, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Some work in a [The Complete WordPress Website Business Course][9] on Udemy Course by Gregg Davis. I'm 75% done with this and I would like to finish it. I've found it pretty impossible to do JavaScript at lunch at work anymore, so I'm going back to this for lunch n' code (#LunchNCode).

**Thoughts:**
I really love Gregg Davis' teaching style. He is certainly very thorough. There are some lessons he added to sections I already finished, so I completed those. He is rightly telling people to switch from [MAMP][10] to [Local By Flywheel][11]. Local is easier and it's fine for most purposes.
DId not do anything coding related after work.

**Link to work:**
No link.

### Day 102: [September 29, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**
Re-doing JavaScript and the DOM section of [Udacity Front End Nanodegree][12]. Hoping to understand it better this time. Changes I made to my [game][7] just broke it so I rolled them back.
Read article: [How to Understand and Modify the DOM in JavaScript][13] by [Tania Rascia][15].
Also created a staging site for my WordPress site, just a subdomain of my site. I want to try a few things without breaking things.
Learned about the [Google Analytics Certificate][14] from Google and I want to get that. Adding to my [Goals List](goals_list.md).

**Thoughts:**
Finished Q&A section of Mike Wales' [video][8]. Not really that helpful.

**Link to work:**
No changes to my [game][7] as I rolled them back.

[September 30, 2018] Sunday, no coding

### Day 103: [October 1, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**

Some work in a [The Complete WordPress Website Business Course][9] on Udemy Course by Gregg Davis. I'm now 80 % done with this. Finished section on different kinds of way to set up transactional and/or marketing e-mail and now we move on to the exciting topic of e-commerce. Excited for that. #LunchNCode
No coding after work.

**Thoughts:**

After work, I spent a couple of hours looking for jobs.

- [FlexJobs][16]
- [Pantheon][19]
- [Baremetrics][20]
- [Remote.co][21]

Bought a [Humble Bundle][17] with [Head First books][18] because I wanted the insane price on the [Design Patterns][22] book.

**Link to work:**

No link.

### Day 104: [October 2, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**

Read 10% of [Head First JavaScript Programming: A Brain Friendly Guide][23]. It's from 2014 so it does not have ES6, but it will do fine for some more foundational learning.

More work in a [The Complete WordPress Website Business Course][9] on Udemy Course by Gregg Davis. I'm now 82 % done with this. Spent all day with first born at doctor appointments so after picking up second-born, I went to library for a couple of hours, where I had problems connecting to their wi-fi on my Macbook. Could only connect on my iPad. Restarting fixed it, after saving all my rprecious tabs (yes, I'm one of those tab hoarders).

I did a couple of hours of solid work.

Then I did something crazy (installed a plugin and chose a setting I should not have), bricked my website and had to learn how to use FTP so I could restore it.

Then I received over 20K email messages (error logging) that I am still trying to get rid of. More keep popping into the mailbox. I was able to figure out good parameters for a filter so several thousand more emails will be siting in my box for me to delete tomorrow morning.

**Thoughts:**

Tweet: 104/302: I feel like I made a rite of passage. After 2 solid hours of work, I bricked my #WordPress site. Then I used FTP for the first time and I was able to fix it. Feeling good!
I knew better, had a staging site, but this happened because I didn‚Äôt use it! Shame! #301DaysOfCode

**Link to work:**

No link. Except my [website][24], which works again. üòÖ

### Day 105: [October 3, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**

Up to 15% of [Head First JavaScript Programming: A Brain Friendly Guide][23].

More work in a [The Complete WordPress Website Business Course][9] on Udemy Course by Gregg Davis. I set up a WooCommerce store on a subdomian. Pretty fun. I'm now 85 % done with this course.

Still receiving error logging emails from my snafu last night, only about 4k. Hopefully the queue is empty by now and they will stop.

### Day 106 [October 4, 2018]

All about WordPress today:
[South Florida WordPress Meetup Group][27]. Great info as always. Tried out some #Gutenberg plugins (block-based). Made a new subdomain with the new [photos theme][28]. (Going to replace my Lifecake as I have reached my quota.) Also worked on my store site (learning how to use custom fields and add payment gateways).

### October 5, 2018 - October 8, 2018

Playing with WordPress and looking for jobs. No "serious coding".

### Day 107 [October 9, 2018]

**Today's Progress:**

Started [Codecademy Learn ReactJS: Part I course][26] working with JSX. Completed lesson: Intro to JSX, so 8% complete with course.

Read Codecademy's article: [React: The Virtual DOM][29].

Signed up for Tyler McGinnis Course subscription. He guarantees updates to his course for any breaking changes in the programming language (ex. React, JavaScript). Also there was a rare 25% discount. I can ill-afford it, but I am sucker for a deal, sometimes. Started React Fundamentals course.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Scored a 7/7 on the Introduction to React Quiz. Yippee!

9% complete in React Fundamentals.

**Thoughts:**

Counting on this quote from Tyler McGinnis:

> The better you get at using react the better you are going to to be at JavaScript.

Also taking notes, which I haven't done for a while, and I think it is very beneficial so there is every reason to do it. Taking notes on my iPad while I work on the Macbook. (Notability app for the win).
